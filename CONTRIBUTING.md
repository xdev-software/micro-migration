## We Develop with Github

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from ${{ github.event.repository.default_branch }}.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Issue that pull request!
